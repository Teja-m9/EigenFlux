# Research on the new machine learning algorithm for anamoly detection based on the decompostion of covarince matrix where my new algortihm can outperform the Principal component analysis  for anamoly detection.
# Eige flux workflow 
# Eigen flux works on the principle of covariance matrix decomposition and reconstruction of the original data.
